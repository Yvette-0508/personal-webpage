                <h2>The Problem: Traditional Rebalancing Falls Short</h2>
                <p>
                    Portfolio rebalancing has traditionally been a rule-based process—trigger at fixed intervals or when 
                    allocations drift beyond thresholds. While simple, this approach ignores the rich context of market 
                    conditions, news events, and cross-asset correlations that experienced fund managers intuitively 
                    incorporate into their decisions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Managing a $10M multi-asset portfolio across equities, options, and digital assets, I found myself 
                    constantly synthesizing information from multiple sources: earnings reports, macro indicators, 
                    prediction markets, and real-time sentiment. The question became: <em>could AI agents do this systematically?</em>
                </p>

                <h2>What is Agentic Rebalancing?</h2>
                <p>
                    Agentic rebalancing combines the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with 
                    quantitative portfolio optimization. Unlike traditional rule-based systems, agentic systems can:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Reason about context:</strong> Understand why a rebalance might be needed, not just that thresholds were breached</li>
                    <li><strong>Synthesize multiple data sources:</strong> Combine fundamental analysis, technical signals, and alternative data</li>
                    <li><strong>Adapt dynamically:</strong> Adjust strategy based on market regime without manual intervention</li>
                    <li><strong>Execute autonomously:</strong> Interface directly with brokers via APIs and MCP protocols</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>The Architecture</h2>
                <p>
                    I built the system using a multi-agent architecture with specialized components:
                </p>

                <h3>1. Market Intelligence Agent</h3>
                <p>
                    Powered by <strong>Exa DeepSearch</strong>, this agent continuously monitors and synthesizes market 
                    intelligence. It tracks AI ecosystem developments (OpenAI, Anthropic, open-source models), sector 
                    rotations, and macro trends relevant to our holdings.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Prediction Market Agent</h3>
                <p>
                    Integrates with <strong>Kalshi</strong> and <strong>Polymarket MCPs</strong> to extract implied 
                    probabilities for key events—Fed rate decisions, election outcomes, regulatory changes. These 
                    probability-weighted scenarios feed directly into portfolio optimization.
                </p>

                <h3>3. Quantamental Analysis Agent</h3>
                <p>
                    Combines quantitative signals (momentum, value, volatility) with fundamental research. Uses LLMs 
                    (<strong>Qwen 3 Max</strong>, <strong>DeepSeek</strong>, <strong>GPT-4/5</strong>) to interpret 
                    earnings calls, SEC filings, and management commentary in the context of our positions.
                </p>

                <h3>4. Execution Agent</h3>
                <p>
                    Connected to <strong>Alpaca MCP</strong> for automated trade execution. Implements optimization 
                    algorithms for order sizing, considers transaction costs, and manages position limits.
                </p>

                <h2>Key Design Decisions</h2>
                
                <h3>MCP-First Architecture</h3>
                <p>
                    The Model Context Protocol (MCP) was crucial for clean integration. Each data source and broker 
                    connection is abstracted behind MCP servers, allowing the core reasoning agents to remain 
                    broker-agnostic and data-source flexible.
                </p>

                <h3>Human-in-the-Loop for High-Impact Decisions</h3>
                <p>
                    While the system can execute autonomously for routine rebalances, large position changes or 
                    unusual market conditions trigger human review. The agent presents its reasoning chain and 
                    recommended actions for approval.
                </p>

                <h3>Quantamental > Pure Quant</h3>
                <p>
                    Pure quantitative strategies miss nuance. Pure fundamental analysis doesn't scale. The 
                    "quantamental" approach—using quant signals as a starting point and LLMs for contextual 
                    refinement—has proven most effective for our strategy.
                </p>

                <h2>Results and Learnings</h2>
                <p>
                    Since deploying the agentic rebalancing system:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reduced time spent on manual research by ~60%</li>
                    <li>Improved consistency in applying investment thesis across market conditions</li>
                    <li>Better risk-adjusted returns through faster adaptation to regime changes</li>
                    <li>Created systematic documentation of every investment decision and its rationale</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>What's Next</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm currently working on integrating fine-tuned models specifically trained on options pricing 
                    and hedging strategies. The goal is to bring the same agentic approach to derivative position 
                    management—a more complex domain that benefits even more from contextual reasoning.
