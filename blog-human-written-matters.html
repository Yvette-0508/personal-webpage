                    I typed all this manually through Claude Code, which gives me really mixed feelings. People can sense the unpredictability, roughness and imperfection from what's human written, which is so far different from an industrialized, standardized way of expression.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I used to be a normal element in the industrialized streamline as well, after you received over 20 years of meritocracy-based education and you moved to the United States at such a time point. Building something solid is hard. But even a Chinese who aspires to be creative and cares about this world as any other person would, I don't want to live like a data point, but a human, that can really wield this tool to boost human creativity and dynamism.

                    Thank you my friend for reading until here, and I want to accept all the imperfection of my writing, because it's me.
