                    As the younger generation of investors are using social media to spread investing emotions and express their opinions, with the aid of agent bots, very up-to-date information feed is no longer a bottleneck for them. But audited information with the recommendation algorithms filtered out is becoming even scarcer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    FOMO emotions are flooded on social media and even reflected on lower-end investing apps like Robinhood, which is definitely not a big deal for them because they profit from bigger hedge funds. But we need to wield agents to cool down the FOMO and slow the pace back into what the old-school way used to be — where someone really considers from your perspective.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That's why I firmly believe UI-based investing apps will die out ultimately, because investing itself is a value proposition thing — not about information feed, not about UI, but about critical thinking and an individualized way of thinking, which is better off the crowd.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But a highly programmable pipeline is a must-have, since agents can basically lower this barrier to zero. But know-how is still highly critical — the auditability of agent traces, the data sources, are highly indispensable.
